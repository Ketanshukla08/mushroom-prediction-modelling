This is my submission for mushroom prediction modelling question.
and also this is my first github submission. :p

so in this code, i first loaded the dataset,
broke them into input vs output set,

converted the data frame df to numerical values to get correlation,

deleted the features which don't contribute much to output feature class,

noe to check the distribution ofcategories in features of dataset,i made a strip plot ,

now checking the distribution of each feature data via seaborn distplot,

the distribution of few features suggested their very little or no contribution in outcome(class),

so deleted those columns also,

now, then , i made dummies of input data X,

now finally applied the logistic regression,

i got 100% accuracy , finally predicted the outcome after that.

thankyou

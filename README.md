This is my submission for mushroom prediction modelling question.
and also this is my first github submission. :p

so in this code, i first loaded the dataset,
broke them into input vs output set,
converted the string entries into numerical format,
normalized the continuos values (i.e. weight and radius),
visualized the data again,
fitted the xgboost for training subset,
predicted and  calculated for the test subset,
accuracy came out to be 100%,
so predicted out the classes for the asked mushrom_test input data.

thankyou
